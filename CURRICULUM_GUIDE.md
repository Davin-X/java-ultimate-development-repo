## Learning Resources

### Phase 1: Foundation
- **Books**: "Head First Java", "Java: A Beginner's Guide"
- **Online**: Oracle Java Tutorials, Codecademy Java

### Phase 2: Intermediate
- **Books**: "Effective Java", "Java Concurrency in Practice"
- **Online**: Baeldung, GeeksforGeeks Java Collections

### Phase 3: Advanced

- **Online**: DZone, Java Specialists' Newsletter

### Phase 4: Expert
- **Books**: "Clean Code", "Building Microservices"
- **Online**: LeetCode, HackerRank

## Success Tips & Best Practices

### Learning Habits
- **Consistency Over Intensity**: Code every day, even if just 1 hour
- **Active Learning**: Type code manually, don't copy-paste
- **Immediate Application**: Build projects, don't just read theory
- **Regular Review**: Revisit previous topics regularly

### Problem-Solving Approach
1. **Understand**: Break down requirements clearly
2. **Plan**: Design solution before coding
3. **Implement**: Write clean, working code first
4. **Optimize**: Improve performance and style
5. **Test**: Comprehensive testing and edge cases

### Interview Preparation
- **Algorithm Practice**: LeetCode problems
- **System Design**: Study real-world architectures
- **Mock Interviews**: Practice regularly
